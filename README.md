My name is Diogo Samuel Fernandes, and I am a software engineer. I obtained a Master of Science degree from FEUP and thrive on tackling new challenges and solving complex problems. I am passionate about creating highly efficient code and automating its deployment process. In my leisure time, I like to read books, listen to music, and gazing the stars at night.
