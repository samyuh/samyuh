I'm Diogo Samuel Fernandes and I am currently a student of software engineering at FEUP. 
I am currently writing my master's thesis. In my free time, I enjoy reading and listening to music.

My primary areas of interest are Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Cryptography/Security, and Mathematics. I am also fascinated by astronomy.
